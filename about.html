            Hi, I'm James, and this is my website!
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been coding since the age of 6. I originally started learning
            on an old HP tower running Windows XP (in fact it still works to
            this day). Back then it was 2009 and YouTube was barely playable
            in those days, to consider that most 6-year-olds today like to
            watch YouTube and play <del>18-rated games</del> PG-rated games.
            But nope, I was in the countryside (Kimberley) on a Windows XP
            computer with a slow internet connection and a fresh installation
            of Microsoft Office 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how did I get into programming? Long story, basically one day I
            went into Microsoft Publisher to make some cool things that I could
            print off. I soon got bored and opened PowerPoint and that's when I
            realised that I could do cool stuff like animations, hyperlinks
            and... Visual Basic?!
        </p>
        <pre>Private Sub Button1_Click()

End Sub</pre>
        <p>
            Of course when I opened the Visual Basic IDE for PowerPoint I did
            not know what to do in it. Some time later I met a web developer
            and asked, what goes in those brackets? From what I remember he
            said to put my email address in the brackets (must be a bit of
            JavaScript that he was working on), and of course when I did that
            in VBA, it threw an error.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I didn't think of it much for a while, I just started making
            UserForms in VBA (basically a dialog box that can be summoned from
            a bit of VBA to allow the user to do cool things). Some time later
            I managed to get into a place with better Wi-Fi so that I could
            search up a YouTube tutorial on how to code in VBA. And that's how
            I started to get results! So yeah, I'm still a programmer, so I
            guess it stuck!
        </p>
        <h2>What I can code in</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript (mainly with jQuery and often with Firebase, I also have a tiny bit of experience with Node.JS)</li>

            <li>C++ (Arduino language?)</li>
            <li>C# (because it's very similar to VB in terms of what you're doing)</li>
            <li>Visual Basic (VB.Net, VBA)</li>
