        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm James, and this is my website! I'm a technologist who has a
            particular interest in software development and computer
            programming. I mostly am into web development, but I also find some
            of the other 'genres' of programming cool as well, such as
            cryptography (<a href="https://aur.xyz/coin" target="_blank">I made
            a cryptocurrency...</a>), data analysis and development for embedded
            systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the wider field of technology, I have interests in applying
            technology to help change the world for the better. Particularly, I
            like to apply my skills to improve the accessibility of technology
            so that those who have differing abilities can all have the same
            level of access to information, and I also think that my skills
            would be particularly useful in helping to solve the climate crisis
            that is quickly threatening our existence by the day. I very much
            value helping to benefit others over making money.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing that is lesser known about me is that I was diagnosed with
            Asperger syndrome at the age of eight, which is a condition that has
            various neurological effects. I like to think if it as my brain
            running a different operating system to what <em>neurotypical</em>
            people have. I would say that without Asperger's, I'd probably not
            be as obsessed, focussed or interested in technology as I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2020 (at the age of 16 ─ the minimum age requirement for setting
            up a business!), three other people and I set up a company called
            <a href="https://emux.app" target="_blank">Emux Technologies</a>. We
            developed an app called Proxi, which was designed to be a simple but
            feature-complete coronavirus tracking app. It was made from start to
            finish in just three weeks and was launched for public use over four
            months prior to the release of the UK's official NHS COVID-19 app.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            I've been coding since the age of 6. I originally started learning
            on an old HP tower running Windows XP (in fact it still works to
            this day). Back then it was 2009 and YouTube was barely playable
            in those days, to consider that most 6-year-olds today like to
            watch YouTube and play <del>18-rated games</del> PG-rated games.
            But nope, I was in the countryside (Kimberley) on a Windows XP
            computer with a slow internet connection and a fresh installation
            of Microsoft Office 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how did I get into programming? Long story, basically one day I
            went into Microsoft Publisher to make some cool things that I could
            print off. I soon got bored and opened PowerPoint and that's when I
            realised that I could do cool stuff like animations, hyperlinks
            and... Visual Basic?!
        </p>
        <pre>Private Sub Button1_Click()

End Sub</pre>
        <p>
            Of course when I opened the Visual Basic IDE for PowerPoint I did
            not know what to do in it. Some time later I met a web developer
            and asked, what goes in those brackets? From what I remember he
            said to put my email address in the brackets (must be a bit of
            JavaScript that he was working on), and of course when I did that
            in VBA, it threw an error.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I didn't think much of it for a while; I just started making
            UserForms in VBA (basically a dialog box that can be summoned from
            a bit of VBA to allow the user to do cool things). Some time later
            I managed to get into a place with better Wi-Fi so that I could
            search up a YouTube tutorial on how to code in VBA. And that's how
            I started to get results! So yeah, I'm still a programmer, so I
            guess it stuck!
        </p>
        <h2>What I can code in</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>atto</li>
            <li>HTML (lol)</li>
            <li>CSS</li>

            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C (mainly for doing cool stuff with my CASIO fx-9750GIII graphing calc, but also Linux stuff too)</li>
            <li>Arduino language (I guess C++?)</li>
            <li>C# (because it's very similar to VB in terms of what you're doing)</li>
