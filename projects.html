        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
            Here's a list of my projects, although not all of them. Most of
            them have source code on GitHub. Also most of my projects I work on
            include
            <a href="https://sebastiandoe5.github.io/" target="blank">
            Seb Doe</a> in them (quick shoutout). The projects at the top of
            the list are the most recent.
